# meedo
Meedo is a JavaScript game created using p5.js library. It is an old project with lot of assets, so the levels take a while to load. You can play the game here: http://wp1.hj.se/~kuma18ry/meedo/ Credits: Michaela Koristova (graphics), Magdalena Kubincova (avatar creation, lvl1), Gintare Kunigonyte (lvl2)
